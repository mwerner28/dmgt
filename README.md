## Paper
## Overview
Given any stream of data, any assessment of its value, and any formulation of its selection costs, extracts the most valuable subset of the stream up to a constant factor. Our method is memory-efficient (storing only the selected subset in memory), requires n function evaluations (where n is the length of the stream), and is simple (selects a point if its marginal gain under the chosen value function exceeds a given threshold at that time).
